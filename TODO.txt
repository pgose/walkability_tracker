JavaScript:

- Reject trajectories that never leave a certain radius from the start (Backend)
    - Notify the user about this (Frontend)

- Maybe stabilize the path? optional, maybe do this at the end if we still have time...

UI (frontend):

- Make a Help Button that triggers an "Instructions" Dialog Box (not an alert)
    (See HTML <dialog> tag documentation on w3c)

- Make the Buttons and Menu Icons look nice (CSS)

- If we have time implement a stop watch (so that the user knows how long they have been walking)
- If we have time implement a total distance travelled (updates every so often)

- Implement a visible trajectory that is continually drawn while travelling
---> Perhaps as a testing interface create another tab that shows all of the trajectories and their rating (it can be horrible looking, it's only to test the rating system and segmenting)

- After completing a recording session ask them for a rating (gets saved alongside trajectory)

Server (Backend):

- Pass csv to Geoserver

- Setup Flask Server

    - Fetch Geoserver Data using Flask

    - Decide 3 Datasets

    - Store OpenData Datasets on the Server

    - Implement the {lines & Dataset => Rating => lines & ratings => dots} function using one of those datasets in Python
    --> The idea is to at least use one data set of OpenData data and one dynamically acquired dataset like user rating
    --> Segmenting is also included here

    - Find a way to fuse those datasets into one "walkability scale" dataset.



UI (frontend, new tab, heatmap):

- Implement Leaflet.heat heatmap plugin for Leaflet in JavaScript (https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.heat)

- Create labels for the map; maybe delineate perimeter of analysis visually

Backend for Heatmap:

- fetch point data from GeoServer and pass them to the frontend (JavaScript)
